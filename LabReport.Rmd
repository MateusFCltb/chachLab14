## Exploring Trends

### questions

1. What do you notice about the trends in corn prices?
2. How about demand and supply?
3. What was happening around 2006 to cause the price of corn to rise so rapidly during that period?
4. What can you say from these graphs about the relative sizes of demand and supply over time? Does one tend to outstrip the other?
